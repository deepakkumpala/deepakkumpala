My name is Deepak (Many call me deeku!) and I am a R&D Software Specialist with a focus on the cloud platform and solutions in the medical industry. My passion lies in helping customers navigate their cloud and Azure security adoption journey by designing and debating effective architecture, defining secure strategies, and implementing necessary security controls.
